### Links

- Solution URL: https://rogerdummer.github.io/Preview-Card-Challenge/

## My process

I've started the development using the Mobile First concept.
The layout was divided by 3 parts: Card image, Card main text, and Card list.
In the Card image I used the tag picture and CSS Opacity Filter.
To the Card main text I just added the text and formatted it. I used h1 tag for the title and p tag for the main text.
In Card list i used the tags ul and li.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I was able to learn about HTML tag <picture> and how to use this using media queries.
This tag was really new to me.

### Continued development

I would like to be focused in learning more about CSS FlexBox and Mobile First.
